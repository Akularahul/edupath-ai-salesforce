   - Understanding org editions and capabilities

2. **Git & Version Control:**
   - Basic Git commands (clone, add, commit, push)
   - GitHub authentication process
   - Importance of .gitignore for Salesforce projects

3. **Development Ecosystem:**
   - VS Code is the standard for Salesforce development
   - Salesforce Extension Pack provides powerful tools
   - Proper project structure is essential from day 1

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

**Challenge 1: GitHub Authentication**
- **Issue:** Browser authentication got stuck during git push
- **Solution:** Completed authentication in Edge browser, push succeeded
- **Lesson:** Be patient with authentication flows, don't close browser windows prematurely

**Challenge 2: .gitignore Template**
- **Issue:** Salesforce template not available in GitHub dropdown
- **Solution:** Created .gitignore manually with proper Salesforce exclusions
- **Lesson:** Manual configuration is common and acceptable in development

## 📝 Personal Notes

Week 1 was all about foundation and setup. While waiting for Education Cloud trial approval, the decision to build custom objects provides a deeper understanding of Salesforce data modeling. This hands-on approach will be valuable when interviewing and explaining design decisions.

Excited to start building actual Salesforce functionality in Week 2! 🚀
